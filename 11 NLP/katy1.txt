Cause you are hot then you are cold
You are yes then you are no
You are in then you are out
You are up then you are down
You are wrong when it is right
It is black and it is white
We fight we break up
We kiss we make up
You do not really want to stay no
But you do not really want to go
You are hot then you are cold
You are yes then you are no
You are in then you are out
You are up then you are down
